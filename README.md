# A* (AStar) Path Planning Algorithm

This project contains a Java and Python Grid based implementation of the A* (A Star) path planning algorithm. It includes an example test driver command line program.

Grid Maps for the algorithm can be created manually or read from a text file generated using this [online ascii maze generator tool](https://www.dcode.fr/maze-generator).
